Created repository.


This was a personal project, so there are two immediate goals to make this project more accessible:

0) Making the names of variables more understandable
1) Removing the need to hard-code credentials for the program to function

After that is done, the objectives are (list is incomplete and unspecific):

0) Parse server responses more rubustly
1) Create a logging system
